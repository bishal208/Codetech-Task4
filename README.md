# Business Optimization Using Linear Programming with PuLP

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based solution for a real-world business optimization problem using linear programming techniques. The problem is formulated, solved, and analyzed using the PuLP library, a powerful open-source linear programming toolkit in Python.

## Problem Description
The objective of this project is to optimize [briefly describe the business problem, e.g., "production planning to maximize profit while considering resource constraints" or "supply chain cost minimization under capacity limits"]. The model includes decision variables, constraints, and an objective function representing the business goals.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **PuLP**: Python library for linear programming
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and demonstration
- Other dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

## Repository Contents
- `business_optimization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the problem setup, solution process, and result analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages to run the notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

 # Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

 # Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
     jupyter notebook business_optimization.ipynb

 ## Output 
- Problem setup with clear definition of variables and constraints
- Optimization model implementation using PuLP
- Solution results displaying optimal production quantities and maximum profit
- Insights explaining the business implications of the solution

        Status: 1
        Optimal units of Product A: 30.0
        Optimal units of Product B: 20.0
        Maximum Profit: $1800.0
